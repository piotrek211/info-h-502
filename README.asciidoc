INFO-H-502 opengl project by Piotr Rochala
---------------------

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

On linux there can be a problem with #pragma once in the header files.

Compiling the code (linux)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ sudo make install


The compilation of ARGoS simulation is configured through CMake.

Compiling the code (windows, visual studio)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

For windows, visual studio was used with built in cmake.
Just open the folders in vs and run the cmake.
Try to run it in x64-release version becuase it takes a long time to load in x64-debug.
